This project was created for Project 1 of the Udacity Android Nanodegree.  

The purpose of this app at this stage was to create an app that displays a grid of movie posters.  The movie posters are populated by using The Movie DB Api.  The user can sort the movies by rating and by popularity by going into the settings menu.  When a user selects a movie, they are taken to a detail view which gives them some additional information on that particular movie.
